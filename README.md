# RNN Music Generation 🎵

This project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for music sequence generation using PyTorch.

## 📌 Project Highlights
- Framework: PyTorch
- Model: LSTM-based character-level music generation
- Data: ABC notation text-based music dataset
- Output: AI-generated music samples

## 📁 Project Structure
- `RNN_Music_Generation.ipynb`: Complete Jupyter notebook for training and generating music.
- `data/`: Directory to store music text corpus (if applicable).
- `models/`: (Optional) RNN model definitions.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies (e.g., `torch`, `numpy`).

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook RNN_Music_Generation.ipynb
